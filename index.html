        <h2 id="more">Jam to a different kind of Music</h2>
        <p>
            Post-punk is a genre of music that emerged in the late 1970s as an experimental and eclectic mix of punk rock and other genres such as funk and reggae. The genre's ability to constantly evolve and push the boundaries of what is considered popular music. Mimi Haddon's book, "What is Post-Punk? Genre and Identity in Avant-Garde Popular Music," provides a deep dive into the history and identity of post-punk, highlighting the genre's impact on music and culture.

        </p>
        <p>
            One of the defining characteristics of post-punk is the use of the typical rock setup, which includes an electric guitar that plays both lead and chords, a drum kit, and a bass guitar. However, what sets post-punk apart is its willingness to experiment and incorporate elements from other genres. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another aspect of post-punk that I find intriguing is its exploration of themes such as politics, identity, and society. Many post-punk bands were inspired by the political and social unrest of the time, and their music often reflected this. The genre's exploration of these themes continues to resonate with listeners today, making post-punk a timeless genre that continues to inspire new generations of musicians.

            <h4>Drab Majesty</h4>
            <p>Drab Majesty is an American musical project founded by Andrew Clinco in Los Angeles, California in 2011. Clinco, the drummer for the band Marriages, adopted the androgynous character of Deb Demure for the project. Keyboardist and vocalist Mona D (Alex Nicolaou) joined the band in 2016.

                Since signing to Dais Records, Drab Majesty has released three albums: Careless (2015), The Demonstration (2017) and Modern Mirror (2019).
                
                Drab Majesty combine androgynous aesthetics and commanding vocals with futuristic and occult lyrics, a style Demure refers to as, "tragic wave." To create his imposing stage presence, Demure employed costumes, makeup and props to accompany his lush, '80s-influenced soundscapes.</p>

             <h4>Boy Harsher</h4>
             <p>
                Boy Harsher is an American electronic music group, formed in 2013 in Savannah, Georgia. Currently based in Northampton, Massachusetts, the band consists of vocalist Jae Matthews and producer Augustus Muller. The band has amassed a cult following since their formation, and their song "Pain" has become an underground hit. Matthews and Muller own and run the label Nude Club, which is exclusively devoted to Boy Harsher and related artists. Boy Harsher is often labeled as a dark wave group, with influences ranging from early forms of industrial to electronic body music. 
                Boy Harsher draws heavily from cinema, theatrics and graphic design to tailor the band's visual imagery. I discovered them abot two years ago and have gone to several concerts.

            <h4>Lebanon Hanover</h4>
            <p>Lebanon Hanover are a British-German post-punk duo formed in 2010 in Sunderland, England. The band consists of Swiss vocalist and guitarist Larissa Iceglass and British vocalist, bassist and synthesist William Maybelline.
               The group is signed to Greece's Fabrika Records and has released six studio albums to date. Their name comes from two neighbouring towns (Lebanon and Hanover) in New Hampshire, United States.
               Lebanon Hanover's music has been compared to 1980s gothic rock and post-punk acts such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure and Bauhaus. This band has closer ties to its post-punk roots than prior bands mentioned. I didn't start listening to them until recently but thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
